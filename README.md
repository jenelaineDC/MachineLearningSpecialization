# Machine Learning Specialization

### üìÅ About the Repository:
This repository contails all my python notebook assignments and laboratory for the course I have taken in Coursera "Machine Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng from DeepLearningAI and Stanford University.

---

### üéì About the Course:
The Machine Learning Specialization is a foundational series that covers the core principles and techniques of machine learning. It‚Äôs designed to help learners build a strong intuition for algorithms and their applications in real-world scenarios.
